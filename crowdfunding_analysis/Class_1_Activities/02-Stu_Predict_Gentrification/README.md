# Predicting Gentrification

This thought experiment will explore **gentrification**, a social phenomenon where affluent people move to lower-income neighbourhoods.

## Instructions

In your groups, discuss the following questions:

* What signs might indicate that gentrification is happening?

* What means can we use to determine how long the trend has been happening?

* What proxies might we use to identify gentrification in non-obvious ways?

* How might you create a visualisation of this data to best “tell the story”?

Pay special attention to details like:

* What data will you use to build your model?

* How will you retrieve the data?

* What is your final “story”?
