# Variance, Standard Deviation, and Z-Score Review

It is now your turn to practice summarising the variability of a dataset by using employment data from 2018 to 2019 in Australia's Greater Capital City Statistical Areas, or [Statistical Area Level 4](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/standards/australian-statistical-geography-standard-asgs-edition-3/jul2021-jun2026/main-structure-and-greater-capital-city-statistical-areas/statistical-area-level-4#:~:text=Statistical%20Area%20Level%204%20(SA4s,Census%20of%20Population%20and%20Housing.)).

## Instructions

* Open the [variance_review.xlsx](Unsolved/variance_review.xlsx) workbook that contains your raw data.

* Make a copy of the worksheet. This way, if you make any mistakes, you will have a backup of the original dataset.

* Create a new sheet in the workbook, and name the sheet "Summary Table".

  * If you are uncertain of how to make a new sheet in an Excel workbook, refer to the [Insert or delete a worksheet](https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/insert-or-delete-a-worksheet-19d3d21e-a3b3-4e13-a422-d1f43f1faaf2) Microsoft Office support page.

* Within the new sheet, create a `State` column, which contains the following states:

  * `New South Wales`

  * `Victoria`

  * `Queensland`

  * `South Australia`

  * `Western Australia`

* For each state, determine the mean, variance and standard deviation for the overall median income.

* Based upon your calculated summary statistics, determine which state had the highest average median income. What was the median income?

* Based upon your calculated summary statistics, determine which state had the greatest difference in median income across all of its statistical areas.

* Based upon your calculated summary statistics, determine which state had the lowest variance in median income. What was the median income?

* Create a new sheet in the workbook, and name the sheet "Western Australia Z-Scores".

* Within this new sheet, copy over the `Statistical Area` and `Median Income` columns from the raw data for only the state `Western Australia`.

* Calculate the z-score for the overall median income by statistical area across the whole state.

* Based upon your calculated z-scores, determine which statistical area had the largest difference in median income from the mean of the state.
